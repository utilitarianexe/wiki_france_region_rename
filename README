tldr: France in consolidating regions. Thousands of wikipedia articles need region names fixed as a result. This program only fixes department, commune, and arrondissement articles. I also only fixes their info boxes.

This project will be a wikipedia bot to handle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests#New_French_regions_on_1_January.

This bots current account page can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Lonjers_french_region_rename_bot. It is currently in the process of being approved.

Mostly using this as an opportunity to get used to existing tools for working with wikipedia.

This uses pywikibot to work. You need an account to make changes and use pywikibot. 
This can be changed in the user-config.py file. Remeber bots need approval. Currently uses my personal wikipedia account but this will be changed when activated.

This currently does simple name replaces on the region in the right infobox
But it would be preferable to do a replace with a wiki data property link. In the process of figuring how this would work but it does not seem possible at the moment.

Progarm is set up to only check regular expressions not run by default. To actually run change the parameter to True for the function at the end of edit_pages.py. You will also need to turn of test_mode in user-config.py.
