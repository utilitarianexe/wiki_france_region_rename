This project will be a wikipedia bot to handle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests#New_French_regions_on_1_January.

Mostly using this as an opportunity to get used to existing tools for working with wikipedia.

This uses pywikibot to work. For the time being going to be pointed at test.wikipedia.com and use my Lonjers user there. Will need to use a real bot account edventually but needs to be approved first.

This can be changed in the user-config.py file.

Note that this is prehaps the wrong approch to the problem in general. Maybe wikidata should be used instead but I would need to look into this.
