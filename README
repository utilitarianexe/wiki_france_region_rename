This project will be a wikipedia bot to handle https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bot_requests#New_French_regions_on_1_January.

Mostly using this as an opportunity to get used to existing tools for working with wikipedia.

This uses pywikibot to work. You need an account to make changes and use pywikibot. 
This can be changed in the user-config.py file. Remeber bots need approval.

Note that this is prehaps the wrong approch to the problem in general. Maybe wikidata should be used instead but I would need to look into this.

your going to need to install pywikibot and do something like
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/peter/project/core/"

Looks like I am getting all the departemtns and arrondissements
